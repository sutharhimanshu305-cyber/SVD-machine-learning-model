# SVD-machine-learning-model
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a mathematical technique used to decompose a matrix into three matrices — U, Σ, and Vᵀ — revealing important patterns in data. In Machine Learning, SVD is widely used for dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and recommendation systems (like in Netflix or Amazon).
